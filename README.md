# Compete-Engine
Compete-Engine is set of Build Systems automations for Competitive Programming. Users can use Gradle Build tool for Java and Kotlin. In addition to that there is C++ build automation scripts with which users can build C++ programs with the help of powerful build tools such as Ninja and GNU Make with makefiles being generated by CMake
